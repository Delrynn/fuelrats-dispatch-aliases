# Fuel Rats Dispatch Aliases

These aliases are ment to help a Fuel Rats diaspatcher to more efficiently dispatch cases, specially in foreign languages or on a high case load. These aliases can be used with the [fuelrats-casetracker](https://github.com/LittleFool/fuelrats-casetracker).
The `fuelrats-casetracker` will only work if it saw at least one `ratsignal` or if you added a case manually with `/addcase`.
